TODO when PlutusTx onchain is ready, but

the goal is to describe `.plutus` format of script files.
Explanation is needed, because there's two formats:
 1. cardano-api text envelopes, produces by PlutusTx
 2. ply compatible text envelopes, produced by Plutarch
where 2 is an extension of 1 and therefore we can use both.
